## File structure

I have organized the files, similar to folke's LazyVim setup, as follows

- lua
    - papi721
        - options.lua
        - keymaps.lua
        - autocmds.lua
        - lazy.lua (loads the plugins)
    - plugins

This is how the files are called:

- init.lua
    - options
    - keymaps
    - autocmds
    - lazy
        - plugins

## Notes

### Formatting C files

Okay formatting C files is quite troublesome, but you can do so using
`clang-format`.

Steps:

    - Install `clang-format` in mason
    - Use `clang-format` in conform.nvim
    - To format using `clang-format` you need to have a `.clang-format` file
        - NOTE: The `.clang-format` file needs to be placed in:
            - the project folder or
            - any parent folder of the file you want to format.
        - `clang-format.exe` searches for the config file automatically starting
          with the folder where the file you want to format is located, all the
          way to the topmost directory.
    - So put your `.clang-format` in like your `$HOME` directory
    - Now you are all set
